**What does "phaedryx" mean?**  
Nothing. I found a generator that created pronounceable passwords and flipped
through a few dozen until I came to "phaedryx". I used to go by "phoenyx" back
in my BBS and IRC days, and "phaedryx" seemed similar enough that I started
using it.

It was unique on Google, but, as luck would have it, some woman who makes nude
skins for Second Life started using "phaedryx" too. I am _definitely_ not her.


**How do you pronounce "phaedryx"?**  
Like "fade-ricks", but the "ae" combo can be a long "e" sound, so you get bonus
points if you pronounce it "feed-ricks".


**What does your logo mean?**  
Once upon a time I was at a middle-sized company. I was the only person at that
company named "Tad". However, after working there for a year, another person
named "Tad" was hired as a project manager over some of the projects I worked
on. This made things confusing. To remedy the situation I became "TheTad" (short
for "the original Tad"). This of course because "thetad" and subsequently
"theta-d" and "ΘD". I made a logo out of "ΘD" and started using it whenever
I needed an image to represent myself. I've since thought it could mean
"original developa", but I'm too white and nerdy to pull that off.
