[<i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i>](https://github.com/phaedryx) I put a lot of
code up on Github, but most of it is simple projects I used to explore new
ideas. My most popular project is a [Solarized theme for Limechat](https://github.com/phaedryx/limechat-solarized-theme).
I also created a [Mukluk theme](https://github.com/phaedryx/mukluk-syntax) for
the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor and a [similar theme](https://github.com/phaedryx/trout)
for the "fish" shell.

[<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/phaedryx) I only tweet a few
times each week, but I try to make them worth reading.
[This](https://twitter.com/phaedryx/status/123434707164729344) is my most
popular tweet, for what that's worth. I am actually most proud of
[this tweet](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/469137307576963072) that
introduced Michael Jackson to the React Router that Ryan Florence had started.

[<i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i>](http://tadthorley.com/) I am beginning to
blog on my tumblr blog again. I have dedicated it to my non-programming writings.

[<i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tadthorley)
I am on linkedin, but I tend to update it only when I switch jobs.

[<i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i>](https://plus.google.com/+TadThorley)
I have a Google plus account, but I use it primarily to play
[Ingress](https://www.ingress.com/).
